            <p>I am a results-driven Engineer specializing in the design and deployment 
                of intelligent systems, from robotics and embedded hardware to end-to-end
                IoT solutions. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between technical 
                execution and business strategy, translating complex system requirements 
                into scalable, market-ready products. With a background that spans real-time 
                control systems and digital marketing initiatives, I bring a unique dual 
                perspective to every project. I am experienced in driving the full product 
                lifecycle: from structured system planning and sensor integration to brand 
                positioning and digital growth. I focus on building reliable, high-efficiency 
                solutions that are not only technically sound but also strategically optimized 
                for the market.</p>

                    I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from 
                    National University Fairview in 2024. During my time at university, 
                    I developed a strong foundation in computer engineering principles, 
                    including programming, embedded systems, IoT, electronics, and system design. 
                    I actively participated in various projects and extracurricular activities 
                    that enhanced my technical skills and teamwork abilities. My academic journey 
                    provided me with the knowledge and practical experience necessary to excel 
                    in the field of computer engineering.

                    This was my first professional role after graduating. Two days after graduation,
                    I relocated to a province in the Philippines to join the company’s Research and 
                    Development robotics department. Together with a senior engineer, I was tasked 
                    with developing a Line-Following Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) prototype designed 
                    for a mailroom environment, capable of retrieving and delivering mail and packages.
                    Through this role, I gained hands-on experience with the full product development 
                    lifecycle in a corporate setting, including planning, system design, prototyping, 
                    testing, documentation, and reporting. I also developed strong collaboration skills 
                    by working closely with engineers across the team. My responsibilities covered 
                    multiple aspects of the project, including circuit design, sensor integration, chassis 
                    construction, wiring, testing, and 3D printing. I implemented real-time firmware on the 
                    microcontroller for motor control and sensor processing, while a Raspberry Pi served 
                    as the master controller, executing navigation logic and issuing movement commands to 
                    the AGV. In addition, I contributed to documenting the entire development process from 
                    concept to prototype completion.

                    After completing my internship, I received an offer to work as an 
                    IoT Solutions Engineer at a startup company. In this role, I was 
                    introduced to LoRa and LoRaWAN technologies and became responsible 
                    for designing and implementing IoT solutions centered around these 
                    platforms. In addition to technical development, I contributed to 
                    evangelizing LoRa/LoRaWAN by creating marketing materials, attending 
                    industry events, and conducting seminars. My work focused on sensor 
                    integration, cloud connectivity, and data analytics to deliver 
                    end-to-end IoT solutions. I collaborated directly with the company's 
                    co-owner, as we were a small two-person team, which required me to work 
                    independently and take ownership of my responsibilities. I managed 
                    individual tasks such as research, development, and strategic planning 
                    to build scalable IoT platforms, while also providing technical support 
                    to ensure the seamless deployment and operation of IoT systems.

                    My former employer from IoT Launcher, where I previously served as a 
                    Solutions Engineer, later founded a new company and invited me to join 
                    as a co-founder. Together, we established a startup focused on delivering 
                    IoT devices and solutions based on LoRa and LoRaWAN technologies. I assumed 
                    the role of Solutions Engineer while also serving as Interim CEO during the 
                    company's early stages. In this dual capacity, I was responsible for both 
                    the technical execution and the strategic direction of the company. On the 
                    technical side, I designed and implemented end-to-end IoT solutions, tested 
                    and validated company-developed devices, produced technical documentation, 
                    integrated sensors, managed cloud connectivity, and performed data analysis 
                    to deliver actionable insights for clients. On the business side, I led 
                    operational activities, marketing initiatives, client relations, customer 
                    presentations, and pitches to prospective clients, as well as supporting 
                    early fundraising efforts. This experience provided me with a comprehensive 
                    understanding of both the engineering and business aspects of building and 
                        scaling a technology startup.
